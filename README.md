# Project 1: Geometric Deep Learning for CAD Objects

## Why?

The objective of this project is to leverage Geometric Deep Learning to derive meaningful representations from 3D CAD objects. This project is a stepping stone towards my broader mission of becoming an expert in generative digital manufacturing, which requires the embedding of complex objects using geometric deep learning. 

## What?

The primary task for this project is to design and train a basic GeoCNN model to classify CAD objects. The model will be trained on the "ModelNet10 - Princeton 3D Object Dataset". 

This project will:

- Experiment with geometric deep learning models, particularly GeoCNN
- Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) in a Machine Learning project
- Apply the learned model to classify CAD objects

This project will not:

- Implement unsupervised learning for object queries. This is a feature intended for future development.
- Cover advanced or specialized Geometric Deep Learning techniques

## How?

The project will be executed in the following steps:

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Download the ModelNet10 dataset and preprocess it for our GeoCNN model.
2. **Model Design:** Define the architecture of a basic GeoCNN model.
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Prior to training, write tests to ensure model and data pipeline correctness.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train the GeoCNN on the ModelNet10 dataset, evaluate its performance, and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
5. **Documentation:** Write comprehensive documentation on the implementation and results.

## SMART Goal   

Over the upcoming weekend, I will build a GeoCNN model for 3D CAD object classification and practice Test-Driven Development, aiming to achieve at least 85% accuracy on the test set of the ModelNet10 dataset. This project will enhance my understanding of Geometric Deep Learning and is a key step towards my broader mission of becoming an expert in generative digital manufacturing.

## Future Work

In the future, the scope of this project could be expanded to include unsupervised learning methods for creating embeddings of CAD objects. This could be useful for more complex tasks like object detection, similarity search, and more.
